_Do you have difficulties running a large number of BLAST searches?<br>
Do you have proprietary sequence data to BLAST and cannot use the NCBI BLAST web site?<br> 
Do you want to avoid the work to set up and maintain the (command-line) BLAST+ applications?_<br>

If you answered yes to any of these questions, running your own BLAST server on the cloud maybe your best solution.
