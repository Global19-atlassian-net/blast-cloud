Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is a popular sequence similarity
search tool. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) maintains
a public BLAST server at
[blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The NCBI BLAST server
is intended mainly for interactive use, with the expectation that users will
perform a moderate number of searches (i.e., 10-20) per day. 

Some users have
many more searches to perform than can be accommodated at the NCBI site. For
such batch users, the NCBI offers the stand-alone BLAST+ package that can be
run on local hardware. Running the stand-alone package requires that the user
have access to sufficient compute resources (e.g., a local cluster) as well as
some degree of familiarity with IT issues and command-line applications.

Additionally, some users do not need to perform a large number of searches on a
regular basis, but may need to do so occasionally. Some users have proprietary
sequence data to search and cannot use the NCBI BLAST web site.
A cloud provider may offer an acceptable solution for these scenarios.
